My name is Slade! In my free time, I develop websites, design things for operating systems (how they work, interact with users, etc.), and all sorts of other things. You can find me online at [sladewatkins.com](https://www.sladewatkins.com)!

I'm co-founder of the independent group (not a company, yet!) [@Wallymer](https://github.com/Wallymer) alongside one of my best friends, Ash Fox. My responsibilities mainly include being the head & oversight of the group. Additionally, I also work at [Kakariko Herald](https://www.kakarikoherald.com) and help test the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org)!

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sladewatkins) or email me at [www.sladewatkins.com/contact](https://www.sladewatkins.com/contact) (git-related emails should go to: [srw@sladewatkins.net](mailto:srw@sladewatkins.net)
**ALL [@Wallymer](https://github.com/Wallymer) INQUIRIES MUST GO TO** [info@wallymer.com](mailto:info@wallymer.com).
