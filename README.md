### Hey, it's me, Slade Watkins! ðŸ‘€ 

My name is Slade! In my free time, I develop websites, design things for operating systems (how they work, interact with users, etc.), and all sorts of other things. You can find me online at [sladewatkins.com](https://www.sladewatkins.com)!

I'm co-founder of the independent group (not a company!) [@OneTwentyFour](https://github.com/onetwentyfour) Media alongside one of my best friends, Ash Fox. My responsibilities mainly include being the head & oversight of the group.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sladewatkins) or email me: [slade@sladewatkins.com](slade@sladewatkins.com) / **ALL [@OneTwentyFour](https://github.com/onetwentyfour) INQUIRIES MUST GO TO** [swatkins@onetwentyfour.net](mailto:swatkins@onetwentyfour.net).
