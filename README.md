### Hey, it's me, Slade Watkins! ðŸ‘€ 

My name is Slade! In my free time, I develop websites, design things for operating systems (how they work, interact with users, etc.), and all sorts of other things. You can find me online at [sladewatkins.com](https://www.sladewatkins.com)!

Soon, I'll officially be a co-founder of [@OneTwentyFour](https://github.com/onetwentyfour) Media (the official company) alongside one of my best friends, Ash Fox.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sladewatkins) or email me [slade@sladewatkins.com](mailto:slade@sladewatkins.com). OneTwentyFour Media related inquiries should go to [swatkins@onetwentyfour.net](mailto:swatkins@onetwentyfour.net).
