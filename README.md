# :wave: *Hi there, I'm Slade!*

![logo3.png](logo3.png)

My name is Slade! In my free time, I develop websites, design things for operating systems (how they work, interact with users, etc.), and all sorts of other things. You can find me online at [sladewatkins.com](https://www.sladewatkins.com)!

I'm co-founder of the independent group (not a company, yet!) [@Wallymer](https://github.com/Wallymer) alongside one of my best friends, Ash Fox. My responsibilities mainly include being the head & oversight of the group.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sladewatkins) or email me: [slade@sladewatkins.com](slade@sladewatkins.com) / **ALL [@Wallymer](https://github.com/Wallymer) INQUIRIES MUST GO TO** [wallymer@wallymer.com](mailto:wallymer@wallymer.com).
